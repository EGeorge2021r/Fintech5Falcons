# Fintech5Falcons Project Overview
The aim of the project is to establish quantitatively that proximity of central markets, using Starbucks as a case study makes a significant difference on estimated home values, appreciation, and average tax amounts in the neighborhood. This algorithm will help investors to determine which neighborhood to invest in property that will produce maximum return on investment.


## User Story

Research Questions and Answers: 
Question: Do home's proximity to Starbucks make significant differences among estimated home values, appreciation, and average tax amounts.

Answers: To establish quantitatively that proximity of Starbucks ( a case study in Austin city Texas) make significant differences among estimated values, appreciation, and average tax amounts.


## Usage Installation
Python, SQL Jupyter notebook that contains data preparation, analysis, and visualizations
GitHub repository Pyviz development environment


### Technology and libraries used in the analysis
import pandas as pd
import hvplot.pandas
from pathlib import Path
import numpy as np
import os
Voilà library . import numpy as np . import pandas as pd . import hvplot.pandas . import sqlalchemy . from pathlib import Path

## Application/Summary of the Analysis
Starbucks locations is driven by property value and higher median income   
Multiple starbucks locations are clustered in some zip codes   
Project aim achieved as it can be correlated through data analysis.
Further research required to see how this reflects similar markets
